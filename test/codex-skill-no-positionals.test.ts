// VAS-2403. A skill body may not contain a dollar sign followed by a single digit, because the
// harness REWRITES those tokens with the arguments the skill was invoked with, before the model
// ever reads the file.
//
// This is not a shell-correctness rule and it must not be read as one. The construct this replaced
// was perfectly good shell — paths passed as argv, read back as positionals, chosen deliberately
// over a splice that had been measured EXECUTING a path. It was correct on disk and corrupted in
// flight, which is the only reason it is banned here.
//
// Measured on a real `/codex review --loop`: the delivered text carried `--prompt-file "--loop"`,
// and an unrelated display line reading `Est. cost: ~<dollar-zero>.12` arrived as `~review.12`.
// The substitution is ZERO-INDEXED over the argument string, so dollar-zero is the first token —
// which is why the ban covers 0 and not just 1 through 9, and why a reader reasoning from shell
// convention (where argv[0] is the program name and nobody interpolates it) would leave the worst
// case in place.
//
// The failure is silent at the point a human looks. The adapter receives a prompt file named
// `--loop`, exits 2, and the skill reports ROUND NOT RUN — a message about prompt files, on a run
// whose prompt file is fine. Nothing anywhere says "your skill text was rewritten".
// Same resolution chain as bin/gstack-paths (TMPDIR -> TMP -> project-local .gstack/tmp), and
// writability is PROBED rather than assumed — a directory named by TMPDIR is a claim, and an
// existing-but-read-only one makes mkdirSync a no-op success. An earlier version of this file fell
// back to a hardcoded '/tmp', which throws EROFS on a read-only-temp runner and would have failed
// this contract test while the launcher it guards was perfectly correct.
//
// Copied rather than imported from outside-voice-config.test.ts, deliberately and for that file's
// own stated reason: importing a *.test.ts for a helper makes bun execute its suite a second time
// on every full run, and a test that runs twice reports its failures twice and no longer owns its
